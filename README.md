# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system built using machine learning algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences and past ratings. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to recommend movies that are most likely to interest the user.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the ratings given by similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their features, such as genre, director, and actors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input their preferences and receive movie suggestions.
- **Data Visualizations**: Displays insights into the dataset and recommendation results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the development of the system.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for implementing recommendation algorithms.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for presenting insights.
